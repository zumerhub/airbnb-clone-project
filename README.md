### 2. Frontend Developer
Builds the user interface and ensures a seamless user experience. Implements responsive layouts and integrates frontend components with backend APIs.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, secures, and manages the project database. Ensures data related to properties, users, and bookings is stored reliably and efficiently.

### 4. UI/UX Designer
Creates wireframes and prototypes while ensuring the visual design and user experience align with project goals and user needs.

### 5. Project Manager
Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures tasks align with the project roadmap. Handles communication between stakeholders and developers.

### 6. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Tests the application for bugs and performance issues. Ensures features meet requirements through manual and automated testing.

### 7. DevOps Engineer
Manages deployment pipelines, monitors performance, and automates CI/CD processes using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.

## Technology Stack
Below are the technologies used and their purpose in this project:

- **Django (Backend):** Provides server-side logic, handles user authentication, and exposes REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend):** Builds the user interface and adds interactivity.
- **React (Optional Frontend):** Enables a dynamic, single-page application experience.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL (Database):** Stores and manages application data like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- **Git & GitHub (Version Control):** Manages source code and enables collaborative workflows.
- **Docker (Deployment):** Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.
- **Heroku/AWS (Hosting):** Hosts the application, making it accessible online.

## Database Design
The database is designed to capture the essential relationships between users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.

### Key Entities and Fields

#### 1. Users
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `email` (unique)  
- `password_hash`  
- `role` (guest, host, admin)

**Relationships:**
- A user can list multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

#### 2. Properties
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

**Relationships:**
- A property belongs to one host (user).
- A property can have many bookings and reviews.

#### 3. Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

**Relationships:**
- A booking belongs to one property.
- A booking belongs to one user/guest.
- A booking is linked to one payment.

#### 4. Payments
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_method` (card, Paystack, PayPal, etc.)
- `status` (successful, failed, pending, refunded)

**Relationships:**
- A payment belongs to one booking.

#### 5. Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `rating` (1–5)
- `comment`

**Relationships:**
- A review belongs to one property.
- A review is created by one user.

**Entity Relationship Summary:**
- A user can be both a guest and a host.
- A host can create multiple properties.
- A guest can make multiple bookings.
- A property can have many bookings and reviews.
- A booking is tied to one property, one user, and one payment.
- A review is tied to one property and one user.

## Feature Breakdown
### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles. Implements secure authentication and role-based access for property owners and guests.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create property listings with descriptions, images, and pricing. Guests can browse updated property information.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can search for properties, check availability, and make reservations. The system prevents double bookings.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave feedback on properties, improving trust and transparency.

### 5. Payments & Transactions
Provides a secure payment gateway for guests to pay online. Tracks payment history and generates receipts.

### 6. Search & Filters
Enables users to search for properties using filters such as location, price range, and amenities.

### 7. Notifications
Sends updates to guests and hosts for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

## API Security
Security is crucial to protect user data and maintain trust in the platform. Key measures include:

### 1. Authentication
- Uses JWT or OAuth2 to verify users.
- Ensures only registered and verified users access protected routes.

### 2. Authorization
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC).
- Ensures users perform only allowed actions (e.g., only hosts manage properties).

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Limits API requests to prevent brute-force attacks and server abuse.

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validates and sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.

### 5. Secure Payments
- Uses secure third-party gateways and HTTPS for all transactions.

### Why Security is Crucial:
- Protects sensitive user and financial data.
- Maintains trust and platform integrity.
- Prevents malicious abuse of resources.

## CI/CD Pipeline
A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Deployment)** pipeline automates integration, testing, and deployment.

### Importance:
- **Faster Development:** Automates builds and deployments.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Detects bugs early with automated tests.
- **Consistency:** Ensures reliable deployments across environments.
- **Quick Feedback:** Provides instant feedback to developers.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates build, test, and deployment.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments.
- **Optional:** Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI for advanced workflows.
