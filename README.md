# Team Roles

### Backend Developer
  Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

### Database Administrator
  Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

### Business analyst (BA)
  - Understands customer’s business processes.
  - Translates customer business needs into requirements.
  
  Business analyst roles includes:
    A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an    abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.

### Product owner (PO)
  - Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution.
  - Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements.

  PO is holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. 

  
### Project manager (PM)
  - Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget.
  - Manages and motivates the software development team.

  Project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.
 


### UI/UX designer
  - Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs.
  - Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates.

There are two aspects to the product design process—user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.


### Software architect
  - Designs a high-level software architecture.
  - Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision.
  - Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews.

An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team. 

A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.


### Software developer
  - Engineers and stabilizes the product.
  - Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle.

A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.

### Quality assurance (QA) engineer
  - Makes sure an application performs according to requirements.
  - Spots functional and non-functional defects.

  The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.


### Test automation engineer
  - Designs a test automation ecosystem.
  - Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing.

  A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.


### DevOps engineer
  - Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams.
  - Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery.

  DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

# Technology Stack

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This features allows new users to register, log in, and manage user profiles. It ensure secure authentication and enables role-based access for both property owners and guests.

### 2. Property Management
Features: Property owners can list new properties (Create), and upload images. The potential guests can browse accurate and up-to-date property information


### 3. Booking System
Guests can search for properties, check availability, and make reservations. The booking system manages check-in/check-out dates and prevents double bookings.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in. This helps maintain trust and transparency between property owners and guests.

### 5. Payments & Transactions
A secure payment gateway allows guests to pay for bookings online. This feature ensures smooth transactions, tracks payment history, and provides receipts.

### 6. Search & Filters
Users can search for properties using filters such as location, price range, and amenities. This makes it easier for guests to find properties that suit their needs.

### 7. Notifications
The system sends notifications to both guests and property owners about booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates. This improves communication and enhances user experience.

## API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data and maintain trust in the platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication

  -  All API requests will require proper authentication using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.

  -  This ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected routes, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

### Authorization

  -  Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to ensure users only perform actions permitted to them (e.g., only hosts can manage properties).

  -  This prevents malicious actors from escalating privileges or modifying data they don’t own.

### Rate Limiting

  -  API requests will be throttled to limit the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given period.

  -  This mitigates brute-force attacks, protects server resources, and ensures fair use of the system.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

  - All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other injection-based attacks.

  -  This ensures only valid and safe data enters the system.

### Secure Payments

  - All payment-related APIs will integrate with secure third-party payment gateways and enforce HTTPS communication.

  -  This protects financial data and ensures transactions are processed securely.

### Why Security is Crucial

  -  Protecting User Data: Prevents identity theft and data breaches by ensuring only authorized access to sensitive user details.
    
  -  Securing Payments: Protects user financial information and builds trust in the platform.

  -  Maintaining Platform Integrity: Protects against abuse (spam, bots) and ensures the platform operates smoothly for legitimate users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline is an automated process that allows developers to integrate code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy applications seamlessly. It ensures that code updates are reliable and deployed efficiently.

### Importance of CI/CD for the Project:

  -  Faster Development: Automates builds and deployments, reducing manual work.

  -  Improved Code Quality: Automatically runs tests to detect errors early.

  -  Consistency: Ensures the same deployment process across all environments (development, staging, production).

  -  Quick Feedback Loop: Developers get immediate feedback on their code, helping resolve issues faster.

### Tools Used:

  -  GitHub Actions: Automates building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub.

  -  Docker: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.

  -  Other Options: Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI can also be used for advanced CI/CD workflows.
