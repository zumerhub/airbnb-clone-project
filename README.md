# Database Design


The database is designed to capture the essential relationships between users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.  

### Key Entities and Fields 

1. **Users**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email` (unique)
   - `password_hash`
   - `role` (guest, host, admin)

   **Relationships:**  
   - A user can list multiple properties.  
   - A user can make multiple bookings.  
   - A user can leave multiple reviews.  

---

2. **Properties**

    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `user`_id (Foreign Key -> Users)
    - `title`
    - `description`
    - `location`
    - `price_per_night`
  
   **Relationship:**
   - A property belongs to one host (user).
   - A property can have many bookings.
   - A property can have many reviews.

---


3. **Bookings**

    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `property_id` (Foreign Key -> Properties)
    - `user_id` (Foregin Key -> Users)
    - `start_date`
    - `end_date`
    - `status` (pending, confirmed, canclled)

   **Relationships:**
    - A booking belong to one property.
    - A booking belong to one user/guest.
    - a booking is linked to one payment.
      
---

4. **Payments**

    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `booking_id` (Foreign Key -> Bookings)
    - `amount`
    - `payment_method` (card, paystack, Paypal, etc.)
    - `status` (successful, failed, pending, refunded)

  **Relationships:**
  - A payment belong to one booking.

---

5. **Reviews**

    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `property_id` (Foreign Key -> Properties)
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key -> Users)
    - `rating` (1-5)
    - `comment`
  
   **Relationships:**
   - A review belong to one property.
   - A review is created by one user.
  
---

### Entity Relationships Summary
- A **User** can be both a guest and a host.
- A **User (host)** can create multiple **Properties**.
- A **User (guest)** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is tied to one **Property**, one **User**, and one **Paymeny**,
- A **Review** is tied to one **Property** and one **User**.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This features allows new users to register, log in, and manage user profiles. It ensure secure authentication and enables role-based access for both property owners and guests.

### 2. Property Management
Features: Property owners can list new properties (Create), and upload images. The potential guests can browse accurate and up-to-date property information


### 3. Booking System
Guests can search for properties, check availability, and make reservations. The booking system manages check-in/check-out dates and prevents double bookings.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in. This helps maintain trust and transparency between property owners and guests.

### 5. Payments & Transactions
A secure payment gateway allows guests to pay for bookings online. This feature ensures smooth transactions, tracks payment history, and provides receipts.

### 6. Search & Filters
Users can search for properties using filters such as location, price range, and amenities. This makes it easier for guests to find properties that suit their needs.

### 7. Notifications
The system sends notifications to both guests and property owners about booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates. This improves communication and enhances user experience.

## API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data and maintain trust in the platform. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication

  -  All API requests will require proper authentication using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.

  -  This ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected routes, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

### 2. Authorization

  -  Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to ensure users only perform actions permitted to them (e.g., only hosts can manage properties).

  -  This prevents malicious actors from escalating privileges or modifying data they don’t own.

### 3. Rate Limiting

  -  API requests will be throttled to limit the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given period.

  -  This mitigates brute-force attacks, protects server resources, and ensures fair use of the system.

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

  - All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other injection-based attacks.

  -  This ensures only valid and safe data enters the system.

###  5. Secure Payments

  - All payment-related APIs will integrate with secure third-party payment gateways and enforce HTTPS communication.

  -  This protects financial data and ensures transactions are processed securely.

### 6.  Why Security is Crucial

  -  Protecting User Data: Prevents identity theft and data breaches by ensuring only authorized access to sensitive user details.
    
  -  Securing Payments: Protects user financial information and builds trust in the platform.

  -  Maintaining Platform Integrity: Protects against abuse (spam, bots) and ensures the platform operates smoothly for legitimate users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline is an automated process that allows developers to integrate code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy applications seamlessly. It ensures that code updates are reliable and deployed efficiently.

### Importance of CI/CD for the Project:

  -  Faster Development: Automates builds and deployments, reducing manual work.

  -  Improved Code Quality: Automatically runs tests to detect errors early.

  -  Consistency: Ensures the same deployment process across all environments (development, staging, production).

  -  Quick Feedback Loop: Developers get immediate feedback on their code, helping resolve issues faster.

### Tools Used:

  -  GitHub Actions: Automates building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub.

  -  Docker: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.

  -  Other Options: Jenkins, CircleCI, or Travis CI can also be used for advanced CI/CD workflows.
